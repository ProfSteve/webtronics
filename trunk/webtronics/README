#INSTALLING mediawiki plugin

The mediawiki plugin is tested on version 1.15
This plugin is currently for a test environment only.
It appears to function correctly but may not be stable or secure.

The mediawiki plugin is actually two plugins

svge plugin adds a svge tag  which displays the image in svg format in the image tag

webtronics plugin is the editor and file upload function.


enable svg uploads

place th webtronics folder (the second one if you use svn to get it) in  your mediawiki/extensions/ directory.
The path should be mediawiki/extensions/webtronics/webtronics.php. 

add the following to your LocalSettings.php

require_once($IP."extensions/webtronics/Svgiframe.php");
require_once($IP."extensions/webtronics/Webtronics.php");

*on debian there are two LocalSettings.php files one is in /etc/mediawiki
 If your changes don't take effect, try putting them in there.
