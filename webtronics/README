#INSTALLING mediawiki plugin

The mediawiki plugin is tested on version 1.15
This plugin is currently for a test environment only.
It appears to function correctly but may not be stable or secure.


1.enable svg uploads

2.place th webtronics folder (the second one if you use svn to get it) in  your mediawiki/extensions/ directory.
The path should be mediawiki/extensions/webtronics/Webtronics.php. 

3.add the following to your LocalSettings.php
require_once($IP."extensions/webtronics/Webtronics.php");

*on debian there are two LocalSettings.php files one is in /etc/mediawiki
 If your changes don't take effect, try putting them in there.
